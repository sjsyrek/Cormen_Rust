# Cormen Algorithms in Rust

This project contains Rust implementations of some of the algorithms from [_Introduction to Algorithms_](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-Thomas-Cormen/dp/0262033844/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1453748746&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=cormel+introduction+to+algorithms) by Thomas Cormen, et al.

I am working on these in order to learn the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/index.html) programming language. I have found that they mostly work verbatim but do require an understanding of the type system and of the concepts of [ownership](http://doc.rust-lang.org/1.6.0/book/ownership.html) and [borrowing](http://doc.rust-lang.org/1.6.0/book/references-and-borrowing.html). They may therefore be useful for other Rust novices familiar with Cormen's book.

I will do my best to document these functions in accordance with `rustdoc` conventions. Enjoy.
